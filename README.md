# Overview

This software prints "Hello World" on the screen using Python 3.9.4.

The purpose of this software is to gain knowledge in installing different software tools such as Version Control System(Git), a programming language (Python, in this case), and an Integrated Development Environment (VS Code). Also, its purpose is also to get familiar with Git, using an IDE, printing out "Hello World", and submitting/pushing the code in GitHub.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) - I used Visual Studio Code as my IDE since it is what I am most comfortable with. 
- Version Control System - I used Git as my version control system to publish this sub-directory in a repository in GitHub.
- Programming Language - I used Python to fulfill the purpose of printing "Hello World".
